# Final Exam Questions

Write 2 or more questions each related of your topics (so, six minimum) that you would like to see on the exam. Try to vary the question type (multiple choice, etc), and difficulty (at least one low on [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/ "Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning"), and at least one high on Bloom's).
