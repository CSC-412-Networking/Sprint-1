# Sprint Retrospective

The sprint retrospective is due at the end of the sprint, however, some components may make sense to complete throughout the sprint, such as the list of resources you are using.

Retrospectives should include the following items:

- An updated Trello board
- An updated issue queue in Github
- A list of all external resources used
- A brief reflection on the process
- Final Exam questions

## Trello Board

All cards should be moved to the correct column, updated with the current status, and match the state of the product.

Link to Trello: *Put a link to your Trello board board here*

## Github Issue Queue

No product is ever truly complete; this is your opportunity to acknowledge the work that remains. Any incomplete items should have an issue associated with them. Any issues that the instructor can easily identify that are not in the issue queue will count against your "Plan" grade.

*Nothing needs done here, as long as your repository's issue queue is current*

## List of External Resource Used this Sprint

All resources should be listed here. For each resource, in a sentence, describe how useful the resource was for you (e.g., "[Sprint Resources](resources.md "Resources for Sprint") - Very useful, lots of links to other resources")

## Future Exam questions

Add at least four questions to the [Final Exam Questions file](exam.md "Final Exam Questions file"). The better the questions, the more likely they are to appear on the exam.

## Reflections

What went well, what didn't go well, and why? This is not a report of "what" you did; it's a reflection on how effective the process was for your learning the subject matter. Each team member should complete a reflection. These do not need to be long, but they should be thorough.

Create a new markdown file in the repository for each student. Link to each reflection here:

[Student 1's Reflection](FIXME.md "The markdown file")

[Student 2's Reflection](FIXME.md "Another markdown file")
