## Sprint Expectations

Refer to the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-YyupBHLcooYJ5Ew0uh4Iaa4U_PRmhoysCPhIsajMR4/edit#bookmark=id.pf3cftfn8tj4 "Syllabus") for the daily breakdown of each sprint. 

During the sprint, a few things will happen, and a few other things will need to be done by you. First, after class on Thursday, August 25th, the instructor and teaching assistants will look at your selections for topics, and create teams. They will be announced in Slack, as well as posted on the Trello board. 

Your job will be to begin conversations with your team via Slack. DO NOT wait until Tuesday to begin discussing your sprint topic!!! That would result in five days lost, and you will have things due by Tuesday. Your team should find a time to meet in-person and begin digging into the resources for your sprint topic and planning out your product. Keep track of the resources you use; they should be added to the [retrospective](retrospective.md "Retrospectives file") file.

On Tuesday, August 30th, class will begin with stand-up meetings. In a stand-up meeting, each person spends no more than five minutes discussing a) what they completed so far, b) what they plan to do next, and c) what they are stuck on or confused about. Each member of the team reports to the group, and any discussion that needs to happen within the team should be done now. The reason it's called a stand-up meeting is they are meant to be brief. So brief, they could be completed with everyone standing, and no one would get tired. 

After stand-ups are completed, your team should have good visibility about where your team is in the process of creating your product. Now, your team will meet with the other team who is working on the same sprint topic, but is doing the other type of product. So, the two teams working on frameworks will meet and discuss their products. The purpose of these cross-team meetings is to ensure that the teamwork and homework products are not repeating the same materials. If there is overlap, discuss where the material belongs. By the end of Tuesday's class, your team should know exactly what the product is that they are creating, and how it aligns with the other team. 

On Thursday, September 1st, first drafts of your product are due before class begins. Peer reviews will begin, where you will test out the product of the other team with the same sprint topic. Your job as a peer reviewer is to provide constructive feedback to the other team. Peer reviews should be honest, straight-forward, but also compassionate. A positive peer review will be rewarded by a much better product at the end of the sprint. A peer review with no feedback is a failed peer review.  In the worst case, peer reviews that include rude comments will be addressed by the instructor, with penalties. 

On Tuesday, September 6th, your final products are due before class begins. All materials for your product should be in Github, including the [exam](exam.md "Final Exam Questions file") and [retrospective](retrospective.md "Retrospectives file") files. In class, teamwork assignments will be completed. You will be responsible for facilitating one teamwork (i.e., your sprint topic), and completing two other teamworks. Each teamwork will have exactly 35 minutes, at which point we will transition to the next topic. 

Homeworks also come out this Tuesday. They are to be completed outside of class, alone, and are due on Friday, September 9th by 11:55pm. 

On Thursday, September 8th, the sprint officially ends with a retrospective. A retrospective is an intentional look back on the sprint, to find ways to improve them for the next round of sprints. Then, a new sprint begins!

## Assessment

For full credit, by the end of the sprint you will need to have evidence the following items:
